🐥 Flappy Bird – Version 1.0.0
🪶 Overview

Flappy Bird (v1.0.0) is a colorful and Python-powered recreation of the iconic Flappy Bird arcade game — brought to life using the Turtle Graphics module.
This project marks another step in Varun Kumar’s creative coding journey — transforming a simple childhood favorite into a visually appealing and interactive desktop game.
It blends the simplicity of Python with polished visuals, fun mechanics, and smooth gameplay loops that make it both nostalgic and refreshing.
Originally inspired by the minimalist design and frustratingly addictive nature of the original game, this version stays true to its essence while introducing clean visuals, physics, and restart/quit options — all powered purely by Python.

🎮 About the Game

In this game, you control a cheerful yellow bird 🐤 flying through endless pairs of green pipes.
Your only task — don’t crash! Tap the space bar to keep flapping and guide the bird through the gaps.
The challenge grows with every passing second as the speed and timing test your precision and reflexes.
Once you hit an obstacle, the game displays your final score and allows you to restart instantly.
This project demonstrates how you can turn a few lines of logic and creativity into a fully functional 2D game — no external engines required.

🧩 Features

🐥 Smooth Bird Physics – Realistic gravity and upward thrust motion
🌳 Randomized Pipes – Every run feels fresh and unpredictable
💥 Accurate Collision Detection – Detects pipe and wall contact precisely
🔁 Restart & Quit Options – Press R to restart or Q to quit cleanly
🎯 Dynamic Scoring System – Displays live score and final results
🕹️ Start & Game Over Screens – Adds polish and flow to the gameplay
🎨 Clean UI – Simple visuals and pleasing color contrast for all ages

🕹️ Controls

Key	Action
SPACE	Flap / Jump
R	Restart after Game Over
Q	Quit the Game

🧱 Game Mechanics

The bird starts mid-screen, affected by gravity pulling it downward.
Press Space to flap upward and navigate through the green pipes.
Every time you successfully pass a pair of pipes, your score increases by 1.
If you collide with a pipe or the boundary, the game ends instantly.
You can restart or quit directly using keyboard controls.
This smooth, loop-based gameplay offers instant feedback — ideal for both casual play and beginner-level coding demonstration.

👨‍💻 About the Developer

This project was designed and developed by Varun Kumar, currently pursuing B.Sc (Hons.) at the University of Delhi.
Originally, Varun began experimenting with Python during school — curious about how visual programs and games come to life.
Flappy Bird (Turtle Edition) showcases the same curiosity, now honed with better structure, precision, and design.
He continues to build advanced software projects including AI assistants, automation systems, and creative apps — while this project remains a tribute to the simplicity that sparked it all.

⚙️ How to Run or Build
1️⃣ Install Python

Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed on your system.

2️⃣ Run the Game

Open the terminal or command prompt and run:

python FlappyBirdGame.py


That’s it! The window will open and show the start screen.
Press SPACE to start playing.

3️⃣ (Optional) Add Sounds

For background music or jump effects:

pip install pygame


Then you can integrate sound files using pygame.mixer in future versions.

🏆 Future Enhancements (Planned for v1.1.0)

🎵 Background music and “flap” sound effects

🌤️ Moving background or animated scenery

🏆 High-score saving system

💫 Power-ups or difficulty scaling

📱 Android port using Kivy or Pyodide
